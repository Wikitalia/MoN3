            <p>What can we learn by looking at online communities as networks of interactions? Is there a “signature of collaboration”, some characteristic that you can measure, like you would take a person’s temperature to figure out if she is well? The question is very exciting; and we do not believe it can be addressed by a small cadre of specialist. Instead, we have designed MoN3 as a natively interdisciplinary event, where online community managers, networks scientists and collective intelligence researchers work together to generate and formalize intuitions. The people who answered the call is super interesting: they come from all over the world, and represent an incredible talent pool.
