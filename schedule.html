<p><strong>Track 1: What makes a community a community?</strong></p>

<p>What, in the pattern of interaction, makes a group of people interacting on the Internet an online community? For example: is a Twitter conversation around a hashtag a community? We investigate this by comparing the interaction networks generated by relatively close-knit communities (like Imagination4People's mailing lists, or Edgeryders) to those generated by hashtags. What do we see? How could we describe why these two patterns are different, if they are? Thanks to community managers in the room means we have an independent qualitative assessment on the tightness of each community, that we can match to quantitative measures of structural cohesion in the networks. 
</p>
<p><strong>Track2: Comparative analysis of interaction networks in online communities</strong></p>

<p>We get to play with data from <em>several</em> online communities at once â€“ what's more, data that have been pre-standardized by uploading them into <a href = "http://catalyst-fp7.eu/open-tools/edgesense/">Edgesense</a>, so they are reasonably comparable. It is a good chance to dig deep into the data and try some comparative analysis. Do different communities give rise to different interaction networks? Or do they give rise to eerily similar ones? What drives similarities and differences?
